# FeatherDisguise
 A lightweight non-bullshit disguise plugin


 ## bugs:
 - ensure all the squids heights are correct to how libs disguise had them
 - make sure armor-stand metadata works, ensure all stand fields are correct
 - go through each entity metadata holder and make sure they don't crash players, improve that code too
 - make guardians yawlocked
 - finish documentation
 - ensure commands work correctly
 - add to legacy and hook up code, make sure all works correctly
