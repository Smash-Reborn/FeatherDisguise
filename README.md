 ### WARNING: UN-FINISHED, NEED TO FINISH BUGS LIST BELOW BEFORE STABLE RELEASE


 ## bugs:
 - when removing the player, tab-bar info doesn't stay in the world for the client, need to add it back somehow.
 - sometimes there are pipeline errors which can cause crashes when players change gamemode
 - finish documentation
 - some nametags could be better positioned (enderman, witch, etc)
